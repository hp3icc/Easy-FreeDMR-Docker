**FDMR Monitor is a "web dashboard" for FreeDMR servers by OA4DOA.**

***This version has been forked from HBMonitor V2 by SP2ONG 2019-2022***

**This branch includes the Self Service page for configuring options through a web interface**  

If you are looking for the version that doesn't include Self Service please click [here.](https://github.com/yuvelq/FDMR-Monitor)

Some of the changes in FDMR Monitor:
- Select options through Self Service web interface.
- TG Count page added.
- Config file added.
- It's integrated with MariaDB database.
- Improved usage of memory and CPU.
- Broadcasting groups has been added to save server's resources.
- JavaScript code was added to support broadcasting groups.
- The code has been updated to HTML5.
- Static and single TG's page added.
- Data QSO's now are showed in the dashboard.

FDMR Monitor has been tested on Debian v10 and v11

This version of FDMR Monitor requires a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) installation there are
some good tutorials on the internet that will help you with the installation.

Self Service has been tested with:
- Debian v10, v11
- Apache 2.4.53 (Debian)
- MariaDB 15.1 Distrib 10.5.15-MariaDB
- PHP 7.4.28

The install.sh file has been improved, now it will guide you throug the installation process, please 
be prepeard with the next information to make the installation easier:
- The location of your web server root folder:
  If you are using Apache2 web server it usually is:
  - /var/www/html/

- The location of FreeDMR folder:
  The script will create a new branch named Self_Service and copy the content of the proxy file into 
  it, the location usually is:
  - /opt/FreeDMR

- Database information:
  This information is neccesary for the database connection, you will need to provide the next 
  items:
  - Database username
  - Database password
  - Database name

```
  cd /opt  
  sudo git clone https://github.com/yuvelq/FDMR-Monitor.git  
  cd FDMR-Monitor  
  sudo git checkout Self_Service  
  sudo chmod +x install.sh  
  sudo ./install.sh  
  
  Now you can configure the theme color and name for your Dashboard from the config.cfg file, you  
  can also define the height of the Server Activity window: 45 1 row, 60 2 rows, 80 3 rows:  
  HEIGHT_ACTIVITY = 45
  
  If you set TGCOUNT_INC to True the button will be added automatically
  If you want to modify or add any other button you will find a buttons.php file in the root of your
  web server.  
  
  If you make any modification to the configuartion file please restart fdmr_mon.service:  
  - sudo systemctl restart fdmr_mon  
  
  You can replace the logo with an image of your preference in the img/ directory img/logo.png  
    
  - You can start, stop, or restart with the next commands:
    sudo systemctl start fdmr_mon
    sudo systemctl stop fdmr_mon
    sudo systemctl restart fdmr_mon

  forward TCP port 9000 and web server port in firewall
      
  I recommend that you do not use the BRIDGE_INC = True option to display bridge information 
  (if you have multiple bridges displaying this information will increase the CPU load, 
  try to use BRIDGES_INC = False in config.py) 
  
  If for any reason you want to reset the database to the original values:
  sudo systemctl stop fdmr_mon
  sudo rm mon.db
  sudo python3 mon_db.py
  sudo systemct start fdmr_mon
```
